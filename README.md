# perl-for-beginners

This project aims to be a friendly and accessible resource for individuals who are new to the Perl programming language. It provides examples, explanations, and exercises to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of Perl and start writing their own scripts.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have Perl installed on your system.

* **Linux/macOS:** Perl is often pre-installed on these operating systems. You can check if it's installed by opening your terminal and running:
    ```bash
    perl -v
    ```
    If it's not installed, you can usually install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get` on Debian/Ubuntu, `yum` on CentOS/RHEL, `brew` on macOS).
* **Windows:** You will need to install Perl. A popular distribution for Windows is Strawberry Perl (https://strawberryperl.com/). Download and run the installer.
